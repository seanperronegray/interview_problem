# README

This business sells materials from suppliers. We want an admin interface that allows users to manage suppliers (Supplier), materials (SupplierMaterial), their ingredients (Ingredient) and the chemicals (Chemical) that make up these ingredients. The user should be able to create, edit, view, and destroy these elements and their associations.

A material may be published for sale on the website when the minimum information is available: has a supplier, has at least one ingredient, and all ingredients are assigned to chemicals. Create a clear way in the admin interface to see what materials are publishable and when not publishable, why.
